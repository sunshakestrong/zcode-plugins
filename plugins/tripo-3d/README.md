# Tripo 3D

[中文](./README_CN.md)

## 0.1.5

Game/realtime recipes explicitly prefer **P2** (more credits than H/P1); **P1**
remains optional for lower cost and speed, and v3.1 for film/render/print. Rig defaults to v3.0, with
animation presets selected from the upstream rig model. Retopology v3.0's
`smart_uv` and standalone `tripo_smart_uv` are distinct billed workflows.
Fast textures require v3.5; `chat_image_1` is retired.

The CLI path requires **0.8.0 or later**, run as `npx tripo-cli@0.8`; do not use
npm `latest`. Verify the version before executing; if unavailable,
stop rather than downgrade. A plan is not a price quote: cost is not estimated
here, and uncertainty needs explicit consent. Never switch accounts silently.
MCP remains the default; missing authorization is not permission to use CLI.
The hook also enforces source attribution and explicit model/billing decisions.

The official Tripo plugin for ZCode. Generate textured 3D models from a text
prompt or a reference image, with rigging, animation, retopology and format
conversion (GLB/FBX/OBJ/STL/USDZ/3MF), and land the files directly in your
project. Built for games, film, AR and 3D printing.

Connect your **international** Tripo account once in the browser
(developers.tripo3d.ai) — no API key pasting. This build's MCP endpoint is
international-only; China-mainland accounts need the China Tripo 3D plugin
build, or the CLI with `--region cn`.

## Components

| Component | What it does |
| --- | --- |
| Skill `tripo-3d` | Main workflow: execution-path selection, authorization guidance, MCP workflow, scenario → tool-chain mapping, input handling, credit rules; plus an explicitly selected `tripo-cli` path |
| Skill `tripo-game-asset` | Game-asset recipes: budgeted low-poly props, LOD chains, rigged characters with locomotion clips, wiring into Unity/Unreal/Godot/Three.js |
| MCP server `tripo` | Remote Streamable HTTP server `https://openapi-mcp.tripo3d.ai/mcp` (OAuth 2.1), including `tripo_plan`, generation, rigging, conversion and `tripo_smart_uv`; available tool schemas are authoritative |
| Hook `SessionStart` | Injects seven rules: async waiting, link expiry, credit confirmation, browser authorization, honest failures, source/version gates and explicit model/billing decisions |

## Usage

Install and enable the plugin, then just describe what you need, for example:

- Generate a low-poly treasure chest and export it as FBX for Unity
- Turn this concept image into a textured 3D model and export it as GLB
- Make a 3D-printable knight figurine and export STL
- Create a T-posed robot character, rig it and add a walk animation
- Check my Tripo credit balance

You can also type `/` in the composer and pick `tripo-3d` or `tripo-game-asset`
from the Skills group.

### First-time authorization

The Tripo MCP server needs a one-time authorization:

1. Open **Settings → MCP**, find the Tripo row under "Plugin MCP servers"
   (it shows "Authorization required") and click **Open authorization**.
2. The system browser opens the Tripo authorization page for the **international site**
   (developers.tripo3d.ai — email sign-in, Stripe top-up). There is no
   region picker on this page. You can sign up on the spot; new accounts get
   free credits. A China-mainland account will not authorize against this
   build — use the China plugin or `tripo-cli` with `--region cn`.
3. The page shows a one-time verification code and opens the Tripo console:
   sign in, type the code into **Verification code**, click **Authorize**.
4. ZCode reconnects and loads the tools automatically. To revoke access,
   delete the API key you picked during authorization on the console's
   API Keys page.

## Dependencies, network access and side effects

- **Network**: MCP tool calls go to `https://openapi-mcp.tripo3d.ai/mcp`;
  authorization redirects to the international Tripo console
  (developers.tripo3d.ai). Results are downloaded from Tripo's CDN through
  short-lived links (about 5 minutes).
- **Account and billing**: every generation spends credits from your own
  Tripo account; each tool reports `credits_consumed`, failed tasks are
  refunded automatically. The skill drafts the chain with `tripo_plan`,
  checks the balance and asks before generating a batch.
- **File writes**: only when you ask for the model on disk, the agent
  downloads it into your project with `curl`. The hook and the MCP server
  write nothing.
- **Command execution**: on the MCP path, shell commands run only to upload a
  local image/model (the `curl` returned by `tripo_upload_ticket`) or to
  download a result. The optional [tripo-cli](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tripo-cli)
  path (MIT) runs as `npx tripo-cli@0.8`, minimum 0.8.0. It runs only after the user explicitly chooses CLI
  and confirms the account, region and billing plan; check the actual version first.
  If it is unavailable, stop. There is no automatic fallback from MCP
  failure, missing authorization, batch work or a request to save files locally.
- **Hook**: `hooks/session-start.mjs` needs `node` on PATH. It reads the
  event from stdin and prints a fixed text to stdout; no network, no file
  access.
- **No data collection**: the plugin contains no telemetry; account
  credentials are managed by ZCode's credential store and never pass through
  the chat.
